## [v1.0.0] - 2023-07-18
First release

### Known issues
- The built-in Fyne GUI file browser is a little rough around the edges. Long filenames get cut off in the default icon view, so I suggest switching to list view using the button in the upper-right corner.
- Also this app is fairly untested. It's based off the code for the old LED Controller Updater app, so most things should work fine.
