# HEX Uploader

This is a companion program to the [WingnutTech LED Controller v2](https://github.com/wingnut-tech/LEDControllerV2) firmware. The main function is to allow uploading compiled Arduino .hex files to a v1 LED Controller board.

## Usage
Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/wingnut-tech/HEXUploader/releases/latest/) for your OS, extract it somewhere, and run it. No installation needed.

Then browse to your .hex file, select the COM port for your board, and hit flash.
